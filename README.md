# Address Book

A simple address book application I started to practice my python skills.

How to run:

To run this program you'll want to ensure you have tinydb and tkinter installed then just run adb_gui.py with python. 

Details:

The user interface was made using tkinter and tinydb is the simple database system to keep track of all the addresses you put in.
<br/>The addresses are stored in adb_db.json and accept names, physical addresses, and phone numbers. 

This program has functionality for adding contacts, removing contacts, and searching for specific contacts by name, address, or phone numbers.

All code written by Lilith Ashbury.
